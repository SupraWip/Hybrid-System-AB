# Hybrid-System-AB
<h3>An Hybrid System that you can use to your cars (Beamng / Automation)</h3>
<br>
This project of mine has been around since january in the works, originally this hybrid system was a dual electric system that I worked with Galactis, but as I found out, it also works, but of course there are issues that still need to be fixed, and that's where you come in!
I want to hear feedback, but also need your help, so it can be future ready in case they change some things in the game.


Also special thanks to wollank for letting me using the LUA file for this, if it wasn't for that, this would be like any hybrid(janky reverse and electric mode)!
