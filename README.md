<h3>An Hybrid System that you can use to your cars (Beamng / Automation)</h3>
<br>

This project was started around 17 of january of this year, originally this hybrid system comes from a dual eMotor system that I worked with galactis around August, of course, I could use the automation electric system from what I've been told, but I didn't like it's power curve back then, because I wanted something more linear, and that's why I decided to experiment that way, plus I wanted to test my jbeam skills anyway. Moving on, it is also in works, it works for now but I cannot promise that it will work in the future, there might be some issues around it as well, so I want to hear feedback, and, work togheter so it's future proof (till maybe, they introduce their hybrid system to beamng/automation cars).

Also special thanks to wollank for lending the LUA file for this project, without it, the hybrid system would be like any hybrid system seen till now, broken reverse, and borked electric mode, I can also say that there's brake regen included, but doesn't regen that much energy as of yet.


Also special thanks to wollank for letting me using the LUA file for this, if it wasn't for that, this would be like any hybrid(janky reverse and electric mode), I also implemented the brake regen, doesn't regen much!
